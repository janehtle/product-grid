# Product Grid (Amazon)
# Week 4 Project at Road to Hire

The project was to create a product grid where it was 2 rows of 4 products, so 8 products total,
that would also link back to the actual product page from the website and company of choice. For this project,
the products were pulled from Amazon with the category being appliances.

For the site, it consists of everything listed above as well as the image, name, description, and price of the product.
The "View" button will open a new tab leading to the actual product page once clicked.
